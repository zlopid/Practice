# Coding practice
"How do you get to be a great musician? It helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It helps to have talent. But ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time." - Dave Thomas, [Code Kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/)

These pieces of code are my practice: small problems done to keep myself sharp.

# Organization
Each problem is stored in a separate branch in this repository. I've tried to keep dependencies to a minimum so that these are easy to pick up and play with on any machine that can compile them.

In many cases, this means doing without a testing library. To keep things compact, when I'm not using a testing library, the tests run in the main program and output in the [TestAnything Protocol (TAP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol). TAP lists the test results, one per line, with either "ok" for a passing test or "not ok" for a failing test, then the test number, then a description of the test.
